# Customer Churn Analysis for PowerCo | BCG X Virtual Project

This repository contains my solution to the BCG X job simulation project hosted on Forage. The focus of the project is to analyze customer behavior and identify key factors driving customer churn for PowerCo — an energy company.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this virtual simulation, I worked as a Data Scientist intern at BCG X to help PowerCo understand why their customers are leaving and how to retain them. The project is structured in multiple tasks, starting with data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and includes modeling and business recommendations.

## 🔍 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Cleaned and transformed client and price datasets
- Analyzed customer churn trends by year, sales channel, energy usage, meter rents, and discounts
- Identified potential drivers of churn (e.g., poor promotions, high meter rents)
- Used Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`
